# REAL TIME FACE EMOTION RECOGNITION
**Deep Learning + Machine Learning Engineering** data science project.

## INTRODUCTION
This is an application that detects facial expressions in real time using a camera. The datset used for model training is [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013).
This app can detect 7 emotions - *angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad and surprise*. 

I built my own sequential convolution neural netwrork with 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers with activation function - *Relu*.
The final layer consists of activation function - *Softmax* for final prediction.
